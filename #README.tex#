\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:orgf3970ef}

When I was at college I had to read a lot of datasheets and documentation from different manufacturers of electronics (i. e. Texas Instruments, Analog Devices, Microchip and others\ldots{}). My favorite and inspiration/copy is Texas Instruments.

I really enjoy reading the docs from them!

I would like to understand how their docs are made, which is the department that do them and why they are not using \LaTeX{}\ldots{}

\subsection{Cover page}
\label{sec:org772a77b}
Just trying to keep it simple. A .cls file based on report class.

About features, the cover can be customize with the next commands: Check

\section{About images}
\label{sec:orgc410ce6}
The file \texttt{Logo-EII-horizontal.pdf} doesn't have any type of LICENSE on the \href{https://www.uma.es/escuela-de-ingenierias-industriales/info/108566/logo-simbolo-de-la-eii/}{web}. As master's student I can use, maybe you don't, be careful with it.

I am really interested in naming conventions applied to projects. I think is the first part of a good story, I define two names the first is common use and the second is like a code, i.e Fat-Man is the bomb, but if I said Fat-Man-DOC-123HAJK123

Do you have one for owns?? Explain in comments and discuss the best :D

Examples:
\begin{itemize}
\item Texas Instruments have names like: TAS5518-5261K2EVM. According to Deepseek
\begin{itemize}
\item TAS: Indicates a Texas Instruments Audio Solution
\item 5518: The specific model number of the IC.
\item 5261: A code unique to the EVM design
\item K2: Likely denotes a revision or variant of the EVM
\item EVM: Standard suffix for Evaluation Module
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

IMO is the first part of a good story like "MarkII" or "Apollo"
