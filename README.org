#+title: Reporti

* Motivation
When I was at college I had to read a lot of datasheets and documentation from different manufacturers of electronics (i. e. Texas Instruments, Analog Devices, Microchip and others...). My favorite and inspiration/copy is Texas Instruments.

I really enjoy reading the docs from them!

I would like to understand how their docs are made, which is the department that do them and why they are not using LaTeX... 

* About code
Just trying to keep it simple. A .cls file based on report class.

About features, the cover can be customize with the next commands:
#+begin_src LaTeX
\type{Name of doc type}
\code{Project Number/Code} % For more info. Look for naming conventions
\titulo{Project title} 
\autor{Author}
\subtitulo{Subtitle}
\resumen{Summary}
\notes{Some notes in Cover}
\contact{Contact footnote}
#+end_src

* About images
The file ~Logo-EII-horizontal.pdf~ doesn't have any type of LICENSE on the [[https://www.uma.es/escuela-de-ingenierias-industriales/info/108566/logo-simbolo-de-la-eii/][web]]. As master's student I can use, maybe you don't, be careful with it.
